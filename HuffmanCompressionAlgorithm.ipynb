    "This notebook discusses the Hoffmann algorithm, compares lossy and lossless compression algorithms. Represents Hoffman's algorithm mathematically. A compression method based on the considered algorithm is implemented with Python. The degree of compression of text arrays has been verified through trials."

    "## 1. Huffman`s algorithm\n",
    "Huffman coding, named after its inventor David A. Huffman, is a widely used technique in computer science and information theory for achieving lossless data compression. It utilizes a special kind of code called a prefix code, where the bit sequence representing a symbol never appears as the beginning of another symbol's sequence. This algorithm was introduced by Huffman in his 1952 paper titled \"A Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes\"."

    "### 1.1 Difference between lossless and lossy compression\n",
    "Digital files can be quite large. To address this issue, compression techniques are employed to reduce file sizes without compromising (**for lossless**) or with some acceptable compromise (**for lossy**) in quality. Two primary methods of compression are lossless and lossy compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.1 Lossless Compression \n",
    "**Definition:** Lossless compression aims to reduce file size without any loss of data. The decompressed file is an exact replica of the original file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:** Lossless compression algorithms identify and eliminate redundant data within the file. Common techniques include:\n",
    "> Run-Length Encoding (RLE): Replaces repeated occurrences of a character or sequence with a count and the character/sequence, reducing the number of bits required.\n",
    "> Huffman Coding: Assigns shorter codes to frequently occurring characters and longer codes to less frequent ones, minimizing the overall bit usage.\n",
    "> Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW): Identifies and replaces recurring patterns in the data with shorter codes, further reducing redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:** No data is lost, so the original file can be perfectly reconstructed. Essential for applications where data integrity is crucial, like text documents, medical imaging, and some scientific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:** Generally achieves less compression compared to lossy methods. May not be sufficient for applications requiring extreme reductions in file size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lossles compression is used to compress text files (ZIP, GZIP), images (PNG, LZW) and audio (FLAC, ALAC).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.2 Lossy Compression\n",
    "**Definition:** Lossy compression reduces file size by permanently eliminating some data, particularly data that is considered less important or imperceptible to human senses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:** It uses algorithms that remove redundant or less critical information. Common techniques include:\n",
    "> Transform Coding: Transforms data into a different domain (like frequency domain), then quantizes and encodes the less significant parts with fewer bits.\n",
    "> Quantization: Reduces the precision of less critical data points.\n",
    "> Entropy Coding: Further compresses the data after quantization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:** Achieves much higher compression ratios compared to lossless methods. Suitable for applications where some loss of quality is acceptable, such as streaming media, online images, and consumer audio.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:** Some data is permanently lost, which can affect quality, especially at higher compression rates. Decompressed files are not identical to the original; repeated compression and decompression can degrade quality further.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lossy compression is used to compress images (JPEG), audio (MP3, AAC) and video (MP4).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.3 Key Differences\n",
    "- **Data Integrity:** Lossless compression retains all original data, while lossy compression sacrifices some data for smaller file sizes.\n",
    "- **Compression Ratio:** Lossy compression generally achieves higher compression ratios compared to lossless.\n",
    "- **Use Cases:** Lossless is used where data integrity is crucial; lossy is used where reduced file size is more important than perfect fidelity."
